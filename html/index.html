		<div>Testing Gravity 2017 is the 2nd Testing Gravity conference hosted by SFU bringing together leading experts on various ways of testing laws of Gravity. The 1st Testing Gravity conference held in January 2015 was attended by over 100 scientists from 13 countries. Testing Gravity remains a topical theme because of the unexplained nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the long-standing failure to reconcile gravity with quantum physics. It is particularly relevant given the recent first detection of gravity waves by LIGO. The conference will provide an opportunity for theorists, experimentalist and observers to discuss new ways of testing GR and some of the alternative gravity theories, taking advantage of improving technologies and new observational windows. Topics will include gravitational waves, pulsars, black holes; terrestrial tests, gravity on short distances; particle cosmology, dark matter; cosmological probes - CMB, 21 cm, redshift surveys, weak lensing; modified gravity theories; quantum gravity and emergent gravity. The school on Wed Jan 25 will feature four lectures providing background into main topics covered by the conference. The conference on Jan 26-28 will feature invited and short contributed talks, and a poster session.</div>

		<div>For your travel plans reference, the pre-workshop school will start at 9 am on Wednesday, January 25th. The workshop will start at 9 am on Thursday, January 26th and end at 4 pm on Saturday, January 28th. Conference dinner is scheduled for evening of Friday, January 27th. Arriving the evening before the meeting starts is probably the best way to schedule your travel, and you can stay a few extra days for a weekend in the city or on ski slopes. Further informaton about local attractions will be posted on local info page.

		<div>Getting to Vancouver:Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is well connected to major airports in Asia and Europe and cities throughout Canada and USA. Excellent deals, particularly from Europe, can often be found on holiday airlines, such as Air Transat and Thomas Cook. The best option for getting from YVR to the city is via Sky Train.Alternative Airports:Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre (CXH) is a seaplane terminal located within a 10 min walk from SFU Harbour Centre. An exciting option for people arriving from the University of Victoria, assuming the weather collaborates.Bellingham International Airport (BLI), across the US border, is about 85 km (53 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to BLI can be an inexpensive option if travelling from cities on the west coast of the US.Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) is 250 km (153 miles) away from downtown Vancouver. Flying to SEA can be a more economical option, even after taking the cost of the rental car into account.By Car:If you are coming from US by car, border crossing times depend on the time of the day. 10-20 mins wait is normal during non-peak times, but can easily be an hour if you happen to venture at the wrong time. You can get an idea about the crossing time statistics on various websites.By Ferry:BC Ferries runs several regular ferry lines connecting Vancouver Island to the Mainland. The closest terminal to downtown Vancouver is Tsawwassen. Although Horseshoe Bay terminal is not much further away, it is located on the North Shore. Connection over Lions Gate Bridge could be problematic during rush hour.</div>
		<div>Workshop Venue:The meeting will take place in the SFU Harbour Centre, located near the waterfront in the downtown Vancouver core.</div>
